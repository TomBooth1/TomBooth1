###  👋😄 Hi, I'm Tom,


I Spent the last decade Managing and building Events From Theatre to Festivals,<br/> 
now I spend my time managing google searches and building full stack stuff.<br/>

Please take the time to look around, there are a few humble projects on here, none of which are completed (at time of writing 14/7/22) but soon will be, so watch this space for some big baller stuff!

🤔 I'm Currently working on: 
- My Portfolio Site [Fire From The Booth](https://github.com/Plume93/fire-from-the-booth) (Not Deployed) that I [designed myself](https://www.figma.com/file/zIBuCztelBzlQ9rHRsEil9/fire-from-the-booth) and am building in React.
- An API Based react app called [Make Your Mon](https://github.com/Plume93/make-your-mon) (Not Deployed) that will enable you to make your own Pokemon.

💬 Please if you think those projects or anything in my [repos](https://github.com/Plume93?tab=repositories) is good, bad (especially s@£#), something you'd like to work on or enough to make you want to trade your money for my skills don't hesitate to let me know! Either on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-booth-239715239/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TomBooth453). <br/><br/>

⚡ Fun fact: I'm published in 3 Books. Hit me up if you find any!

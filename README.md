###  ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„ Hi, I'm Tom,


I Spent the last decade managing and building events from theatre to festivals,<br/> 
now I spend my time managing google searches and building full stack apps.<br/>

Please take the time to look around, there are a few humble projects on here mainly exploring javascript, react NodeJs and Postgres to create full-stack web apps, one of which are completed but soon there will be more! so watch this space for some big baller stuff!

ðŸ¤” I'm Currently working on: 
- My Portfolio Site [Fire From The Booth](https://github.com/Plume93/fire-from-the-booth) (Not Deployed) that I [designed myself](https://www.figma.com/file/zIBuCztelBzlQ9rHRsEil9/fire-from-the-booth) and am building in React.
- An API Based react app called [Make Your Mon](https://github.com/Plume93/make-your-mon) (Not Deployed) that will enable you to make your own Pokemon.
-A Community based Uk Unique Locations finder and sharing platform called [Untrodden](https://untroddenapp.netlify.app/) deployed on netlify. This is my Final Project at the School of Code and has been created from scratch by myself and 4 others over 4 weeks. We are in the final stages of this project with only 2 days remaining.

ðŸ’¬ Please if you think those projects or anything in my [repos](https://github.com/Plume93?tab=repositories) is good, bad, something you'd like to work on or enough to make you want to trade your money for my skills don't hesitate to let me know! Either on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-booth-239715239/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TomBooth453). <br/><br/>

###  ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„ Hi, I'm Tom,


I Spent the last decade managing and building events from theatre to festivals,<br/> 
now I spend my time managing google searches and building full stack apps.<br/>

Please take the time to look around, there are a few humble projects on here mainly exploring javascript, react NodeJs and Postgres to create full-stack web apps, two of which are completed but soon there will be more! so watch this space for some big baller stuff!

ðŸ¤” I'm Currently working on: 

- My Portfolio Site [Fire From The Booth](https://firefromthebooth.netlify.app/) (Deployed) that I [designed myself](https://www.figma.com/file/zIBuCztelBzlQ9rHRsEil9/fire-from-the-booth) and am building in React next steps are to get the responsive design all tight and looking right.

- an Ecommerce website for a potter from scratch using NextJS - mainly to test my knowledge and abilities to create a checkout and basket feature aswell as getting familiar with the paypal API. The repo is private but will post the deploy link as soon as it isnt awful :).

ðŸ˜„ Recently Finished Projects:

- [Bootcamper Social](https://front-end-bootcamper-social.netlify.app/) which is a social event database aimed at Bootcampers on the school of code created in a week with 3 other team members from scratch using React, Postgres and NodeJs.

- [Untrodden](https://untroddenapp.netlify.app/) which is a Community based Uk Unique Locations finder and sharing platform deployed on netlify. This is my Final Project at the School of Code and has been created from scratch by myself and 4 others over 4 weeks using a plethora of technology notably NextJs, Postgres and NodeJs.


ðŸ’¬ If you think those projects or anything in my [repos](https://github.com/Plume93?tab=repositories) is good, bad, something you'd like to work on or enough to make you want to trade your money for my skills don't hesitate to let me know!

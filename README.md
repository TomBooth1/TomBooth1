###  ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„ Hi, I'm Tom,


I Spent the last decade managing and building events from theatre to festivals,<br/> 
now I spend my time managing google searches and building full stack apps.<br/>

Please take the time to look around, there are a few humble projects on here mainly exploring javascript, react NodeJs and Postgres to create full-stack web apps, two of which are completed but soon there will be more! so watch this space for some big baller stuff!

ðŸ¤” I'm Currently working on: 

- My Portfolio Site [Fire From The Booth](https://github.com/Plume93/fire-from-the-booth) (Not Deployed) that I [designed myself](https://www.figma.com/file/zIBuCztelBzlQ9rHRsEil9/fire-from-the-booth) and am building in React.

- An API Based react app called [Make Your Mon](https://github.com/Plume93/make-your-mon) (Not Deployed) that will enable you to make your own Pokemon.

ðŸ˜„ Recently Finished Projects:

- [Bootcamper Social](https://front-end-bootcamper-social.netlify.app/) This is a social event database aimed at Bootcampers on the school of code created in a week with 3 other team members from scratch.

- [Untrodden](https://untroddenapp.netlify.app/) - A Community based Uk Unique Locations finder and sharing platform deployed on netlify. This is my Final Project at the School of Code and has been created from scratch by myself and 4 others over 4 weeks.


ðŸ’¬ If you think those projects or anything in my [repos](https://github.com/Plume93?tab=repositories) is good, bad, something you'd like to work on or enough to make you want to trade your money for my skills don't hesitate to let me know! Either on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-booth-239715239/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TomBooth453). <br/><br/>
